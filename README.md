# WrathV3
Wrath Admin V3 is a fully rewritten version of all the previous versions. The goal is to add all of the previous commands and make this more optimized for executors to run. This script is entirely open source, and I plan to add comments to help others understand the more challenging aspects of the script. This will hopefully make it easier for others to learn from and understand the code. 
Unfortunately, I don't have as much time as I would like to work on this project, so it may take me some time to get decent scripting done. I will only send updates to the project that are actually beneficial, in order to make the most of both our time. Thank you for your patience and understanding as I work on this project.
